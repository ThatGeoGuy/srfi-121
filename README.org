* Implementation

The repository hosts a complete implementation of the SRFI, running on
[[http://call-cc.org][CHICKEN]] Scheme.

** File Description

While this repository is primarily to provide a reference
implementation of SRFI 121, it also currently serves as the base
repository to host the library as a CHICKEN extension (egg).  Thus,
there are three files that are independent of the SRFI itself, and are
as follows:

=srfi-121.meta= : This file denotes metadata about the CHICKEN
extension, such as author, license, and dependencies (and dependencies
for tests).

=srfi-121.setup= : This file tells the CHICKEN package manager
(=chicken-install=) how to build the egg.

=srfi-121.release-info= : Describes the URL / different releases of
the CHICKEN extension.

Additionally, the =tests/= directory has been added to accommodate the
CHICKEN package manager (for running tests).  Currently it provides a
default test runner which merely includes the tests found in the
=generators/= directory.
